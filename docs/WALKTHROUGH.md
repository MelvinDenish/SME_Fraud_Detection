# Sentinel-G — Persona Walkthrough Guide

> A scripted end-to-end tour of every feature available to every role.
> Use this to verify the running app the way a fraud-desk team would
> actually use it — and to spot any feature you've shipped but never
> manually tested.

If you've never run the app before, finish `docs/RUNNING.md` first
(Neo4j + uvicorn + Vite all up). Then come back here.

---

## Section 0 — One-time setup

### 0.1 Seed the demo users

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/seed_users.py
```

Idempotent. Creates four `:User` nodes in Neo4j, one per role. If you've
run it before it just prints `Skipped … (already exists)` and moves on.

### 0.2 (Optional) Seed the Tamil Nadu universe

If you want `/search` to find real Indian SMEs (not just the curated
demo CINs), drop `TN_Companies_Master_Data.csv` (or any data.gov.in MCA
master CSV) into `data/raw/data_gov_in/` and run:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/seed_data_gov_in.py --limit 200000
```

That seeds ~191,531 TN-registered companies as `:Company` master nodes.
See `docs/INGEST_DATA_GOV_IN.md` for the operator runbook.

### 0.3 Credentials

All four demo users share the password `Sentinel@1`.

| Email             | Password    | Role           | Persona                                        |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `priya@demo.in`   | `Sentinel@1`| credit_officer | Priya Sharma — SBI Loan Officer                |
| `rajan@demo.in`   | `Sentinel@1`| investigator   | Rajan Mehta — DGGI (GST Intelligence) Inspector|
| `deepa@demo.in`   | `Sentinel@1`| auditor        | Deepa Krishnan — NCLT Resolution Professional  |
| `amir@demo.in`    | `Sentinel@1`| admin          | Amir Khan — Compliance & Platform Admin        |

> **Reset note**: passwords are bcrypt-hashed in Neo4j. To rotate, edit
> `scripts/seed_users.py` and re-run; for one-off password changes,
> drop the `:User` node and re-seed.

### 0.4 Test CINs you'll use throughout this guide

## Section 1 — Priya, SBI Credit Officer (`credit_officer`)

**Scenario:** A loan application lands on Priya's desk for a Tamil Nadu
SME. She has 10 minutes to decide if it goes to her senior with a
"proceed" or "stop" stamp. She's the **first line of defence**.

### 1.1 Log in

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Email `priya@demo.in`, password `Sentinel@1`
3. **Expect:** redirect to `/search`. Top-nav shows her email + a
   "Log out" button. The Reports link is visible (clicking it triggers
   a 403 — see §1.10 below).

### 1.2 Quick screen on a known-bad CIN

1. On the Search page, paste `U45201MH2005PTC155294` (IL&FS) into the
   CIN field and press Enter.
2. **Expect:** route to `/dashboard?cin=U45201MH2005PTC155294`.
   - Risk band: **CRITICAL** (red)
   - `fraud_risk_score`: ~75
   - `data_confidence`: ~92
   - Company metadata row: **Construction (NIC 45201)** · State MH — human-readable industry name, not raw code
   - Evidence chain ≥ 10 `FraudSignal` rows, each citing **specific numbers** (₹ amounts, ratios). No generic prose.
   - Module breakdown shows non-zero contributions from M01 Beneish, M02 Cross-Statement, M09 NCLT/Wilful.

### 1.3 Verify the source badge

1. On the IL&FS Dashboard, look below the `CRITICAL` band stamp.
2. **Expect:** a small green dot followed by **"SFIO · NCLT · RBI — public court record"** in eyebrow font.
3. Switch to Amtek Auto (`U27101MH2010PTC215432`) — same green badge.
4. Navigate to `/evergreening` (DHFL) — grey badge: **"SFIO patterns · synthetic demonstration"**.
5. Navigate to `/itc` — amber badge: **"DGGI Mumbai · company names redacted"**.

### 1.4 Use the severity filter chips

1. Back on the IL&FS Dashboard, locate the pill row between the ScorePlate and the evidence chain.
   It shows coloured chips: `● N CRITICAL  ● N HIGH  ● N MEDIUM  ● N LOW`.
2. Click the **CRITICAL** chip.
3. **Expect:** evidence chain narrows to only CRITICAL-severity signals. Pill row now shows an **✕ show all** chip.
4. Click **✕ show all** → all signals restored.
5. Switch to Amtek Auto — chip counts will differ from IL&FS (confirms it's live, not hardcoded).

### 1.5 Inspect the evidence graph

1. Click the **Graph** tab in the nav, or navigate to
   `/graph/U45201MH2005PTC155294`.
2. **Expect:** D3 force-layout with the IL&FS node at centre, director
   nodes orbiting, shared-director edges to related companies.
   Labels render only after the simulation settles (`sim.alpha() < 0.05`).
3. Hover any FraudSignal node to see its `TRIGGERED_BY` provenance.

### 1.6 GST carousel screen

1. Navigate to `/itc`.
2. **Expect:** the ring SVG diagram at the **top of the page** (above the company cards).
   - Triangle A→B→C→A with arrowhead markers, ₹512 cr label at the centre.
   - Amber source badge below the page title: "DGGI Mumbai · company names redacted"
3. Below the diagram: three carousel cards (Nodes A/B/C) each showing CRITICAL band.

### 1.7 Evergreening view (DHFL)

1. Navigate to `/evergreening`.
2. **Expect:** a shimmer skeleton animates briefly during load (not a plain text paragraph).
3. After load:
   - Grey source badge: "SFIO patterns · synthetic demonstration"
   - DHFL's 4-column metrics grid: fraud risk · override reason · info quality · signals
   - Evidence list with specific ₹ amounts

### 1.8 Honest TN bulk lookup (real public registry, low confidence)

1. Back to `/search`. Scroll to the **Tamil Nadu · live MCA registry** panel.
2. Click any row (e.g. Cherry Gourmet Private Limited).
3. **Expect:** `/dashboard?cin=U10719TN2026PTC192803`.
   - Risk band: **LOW** (no flags fired)
   - `fraud_risk_score`: 0.0
   - `data_confidence`: 25 — **honestly low**, because only a master record exists (no financials, no directors).
   - Skipped modules list shows reasons like `"No financials"` and `"Need 2+ consecutive FS years"`.

### 1.9 Upload to enrich a thin file

1. Navigate to `/upload`.
2. **Expect:** upload form. As `credit_officer`, Priya CAN POST to
   `/upload/financials`, `/upload/gst`, `/upload/bank`.
3. Drop a PDF financial statement (sample at `data/synthetic_pdfs/sample_aoc4.pdf` if available).
4. **Expect:** upload preview card showing parsed rows, then "Accepted".
5. Re-run `/dashboard?cin=<that CIN>` — `data_confidence` should now be visibly higher.

### 1.10 What Priya CAN'T do

1. Click **Reports** in the nav (or navigate directly to `/reports`, then try the Download PDF button).
2. **Expect:** `HTTP 403 — Role 'credit_officer' is not authorised for this endpoint. Required one of: ['admin', 'auditor', 'investigator']`.
   The Reports page renders this error inline — no crash, no redirect.

### 1.11 Logout

Click **Log out** in the nav. Token cleared from localStorage. Land back on `/login`.

### Priya's verification checklist

- [ ] Login as `priya@demo.in` works
- [ ] `/search` reachable; demo CIN chips clickable
- [ ] TN bulk panel renders (if Section 0.2 was run)
- [ ] Dashboard for IL&FS: CRITICAL band, score 75, evidence chain with ₹-specific strings
- [ ] Company metadata row shows industry name format: **Construction (NIC 45201)**
- [ ] Green source badge "SFIO · NCLT · RBI — public court record" visible for IL&FS + Amtek
- [ ] Grey badge "SFIO patterns · synthetic demonstration" on `/evergreening`
- [ ] Amber badge "DGGI Mumbai · company names redacted" on `/itc`
- [ ] Severity filter chips render; clicking CRITICAL narrows the chain; "✕ show all" restores
- [ ] Chip counts differ between IL&FS and Amtek Auto
- [ ] `/graph` D3 force layout renders without label overlap
- [ ] `/itc`: ring SVG diagram appears *above* the three company cards
- [ ] `/evergreening`: shimmer skeleton shows during load; 4-column grid after load
- [ ] `/upload` accepts a PDF and reflects the overlay in next `/analyse`
- [ ] `/reports` returns 403 with the role-mismatch detail string

---

## Section 2 — Rajan, DGGI Inspector (`investigator`)

**Scenario:** Rajan investigates GST input-tax-credit carousels for the
Directorate General of GST Intelligence. He has the broadest access in
the app — upload, analyse, report. A whistleblower has tipped him off
about a Mumbai-based ring, and he has 30 minutes to compile evidence
before a 4 PM raid briefing.

### 2.1 Log in

1. Log out from Priya's session if you're still in it.
2. Login as `rajan@demo.in` / `Sentinel@1`.
3. **Expect:** `/search`. The Reports link is now functional.

### 2.2 Start with the GST carousel page

1. Navigate to `/itc`.
2. **Expect:**
   - At the **top**: the ring SVG — triangle A→B→C→A, ₹512 cr at centre, arrowhead markers on each edge.
   - Amber source badge: "DGGI Mumbai · company names redacted"
   - Below the diagram: three carousel cards (Nodes A/B/C), all CRITICAL band.
3. Company names are redacted because the underlying DGGI case is under active investigation.

### 2.3 Multi-hop director graph

1. Navigate to `/graph?cin=U45201MH2005PTC155294`.
2. Use the depth selector (default 3, max 5) to fan out the director chain.
3. **Expect:** at depth 3, ~15-25 connected `:Company` nodes via `IS_DIRECTOR_OF` edges.
4. Click any director node to highlight all companies they're attached to.

### 2.4 Verify NIC labels across companies

1. `/dashboard?cin=L45200GJ1988PLC011533` (Bhushan Steel)
   - **Expect:** **Primary Metal Manufacturing (NIC 27209)** · State GJ
2. `/dashboard?cin=L99999MH1992PLC066213` (Jet Airways)
   - **Expect:** **Air Transport (NIC 62200)** · State MH
3. `/dashboard?cin=L85110KA1981PLC013115` (Infosys — clean control)
   - **Expect:** **Software (NIC 85110)** · State KA · LOW band

### 2.5 Upload supplementary evidence

1. Navigate to `/upload`.
2. Try uploading a GST payload:
   ```json
   { "gstin": "27ABCDE1234F1Z5", "aggregate_turnover": 22000000,
     "tax_paid_ytd": 180000 }
   ```
3. **Expect:** 200 OK with `{"cin": "...", "accepted": true, ...}`.
4. The next `/analyse/{cin}` call folds this overlay onto the bundle.

### 2.6 Export the evidence dossier

1. Navigate to `/reports`.
2. In the CIN field type `U45201MH2005PTC155294` (IL&FS) and click **Download PDF**.
3. **Expect:** `.pdf` named `sentinel-g-U45201MH2005PTC155294-<8-char-uuid>.pdf`.
4. Open the PDF — verify:
   - `Report ID: <UUID v4>` and `Generated: <UTC ISO timestamp>` on cover
   - Disclaimer paragraph naming MCA21, CERSAI, NCLT as inputs
   - Truncated evidence chain (top-N FraudSignals)
5. The exported row appears in the "Recently exported" table.

### 2.7 Test additional fraud CINs

```
L45200GJ1988PLC011533   Bhushan Steel   → CRITICAL, override_applied: true
U24232GJ1995PLC025935   Sterling Biotech → CRITICAL, override_applied: true
L24201MH1945PLC004598   Asian Paints    → LOW,      override_applied: false, score: 0.0
```

### 2.8 Narrative endpoint smoke test

1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab.
2. From any Dashboard page, watch for `GET /narrative/{cin}`.
3. **Expect:** 200 OK with a `summary` string grounded in real evidence numbers.

### Rajan's verification checklist

- [ ] Login as `rajan@demo.in` works
- [ ] All Priya checks pass for Rajan too
- [ ] `/itc`: ring SVG at top; amber source badge present
- [ ] NIC label format correct on at least 3 different companies
- [ ] `/upload/financials`, `/upload/gst`, `/upload/bank` — all 200 OK
- [ ] `/reports` Download PDF works (UUID + UTC + disclaimer)
- [ ] Recently Exported table records each download
- [ ] Bhushan Steel + Sterling Biotech → CRITICAL + override_applied: true
- [ ] Asian Paints → LOW + override_applied: false
- [ ] `/narrative` returns a non-empty summary

---

## Section 3 — Deepa, NCLT Resolution Professional (`auditor`)

**Scenario:** Deepa is the court-appointed RP on a CIRP case for DHFL.
She's preparing the information memorandum for the Committee of Creditors
meeting tomorrow. She needs the audit trail, the exported PDF dossier, and
the evidence chain — but she does NOT need (and should NOT have) write access.

### 3.1 Log in

1. Logout, then login as `deepa@demo.in` / `Sentinel@1`.

### 3.2 DHFL evergreening review

1. Navigate to `/evergreening`.
2. **Expect:**
   - Shimmer skeleton animates briefly during load.
   - After load: grey source badge "SFIO patterns · synthetic demonstration" appears.
   - 4-column metrics grid: fraud risk · override reason · info quality · signals.
3. Pattern 13 (loan round-tripping), 14 (overlapping timestamps), 15 (related-party intermediary) all fire.
4. Each signal cites specific ₹ amounts.

### 3.3 Confirm the dual-output payload

1. Navigate to `/dashboard?cin=L65910MH1984PLC032662`.
2. **Expect:**
   - Band: CRITICAL
   - `fraud_risk_score`: ~78
   - `p_fraud_calibrated`: a real number (the meta-learner is wired)
   - `p_fraud_interval`: a 90% conformal interval, e.g. `[0.74, 0.95]`
   - `data_confidence`: 88-92
   - `override_applied: true`
3. Severity filter chips render — click each to confirm they narrow the evidence chain.

### 3.4 Export the audit-ready dossier

1. Navigate to `/reports`.
2. **Expect:** Reports page renders (Deepa has the `auditor` role).
3. Download DHFL's PDF — verify UUID + timestamp + disclaimer + evidence chain.

### 3.5 Provenance traversal (for the IM)

1. Open DevTools, navigate to `/dashboard?cin=L65910MH1984PLC032662`.
2. Watch the network tab for `GET /analyse/{cin}/provenance`.
3. **Expect:** 200 OK with:
   ```json
   { "cin": "L65910MH1984PLC032662",
     "signal_count": 12,
     "signals": [ ... ],
     "triggered_by": [
       { "signal_id": "...", "label": "FinancialStatement", "ref": {...} }
     ]
   }
   ```

### 3.6 What Deepa CAN'T do

1. Navigate to `/upload` and try submitting.
2. **Expect:** `HTTP 403 — Role 'auditor' is not authorised for this endpoint. Required one of: ['admin', 'credit_officer', 'investigator']`.

### Deepa's verification checklist

- [ ] Login as `deepa@demo.in` works
- [ ] `/evergreening`: shimmer skeleton on load; grey badge after load
- [ ] DHFL patterns 13/14/15 all appear in the evidence list
- [ ] `/dashboard` shows `override_applied: true` for DHFL
- [ ] `p_fraud_calibrated` and `p_fraud_interval` populate (not null)
- [ ] Severity filter chips work on DHFL dashboard
- [ ] `/reports` Download PDF works
- [ ] `/provenance` returns signal_count > 0 with `triggered_by` chain
- [ ] `/upload/financials`, `/upload/gst`, `/upload/bank` all return 403

## Section 4 — Amir, Compliance & Platform Admin (`admin`)

**Scenario:** Amir owns the platform. His weekly job is to (a) verify
the system is healthy, (b) spot-check overrides for false positives,
(c) review user registrations and assign roles.

### 4.1 Log in

1. Logout, then login as `amir@demo.in` / `Sentinel@1`.

### 4.2 Health checks

Open three browser tabs:

1. `http://localhost:8000/health` → `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","env":"dev"}`
2. `http://localhost:8000/health/ml` → `ok: true` means F1a/F1b/F1c are loaded.
3. `http://localhost:8000/health/neo4j` → `{"neo4j_reachable": true, "gds_version": "2.x.x"}`

### 4.3 Full report sweep

1. Navigate to `/reports`.
2. Generate reports for: IL&FS, DHFL, Amtek Auto, Bhushan Steel, ABG Shipyard.
3. **Expect:** all download successfully.

### 4.4 Override audit

1. Navigate to `/dashboard?cin=U45201MH2005PTC155294`.
2. Open DevTools network tab → `GET /analyse/U45201MH2005PTC155294`.
3. **Expect:** `override_applied: true`, `fraud_risk_score ≥ 75` (NCLT/WD floor per PRD §7.3).
4. Repeat for `L85110KA1981PLC013115` (Infosys): `override_applied: false`, score 0.0, band LOW.

### 4.5 Companies directory

1. `http://localhost:8000/companies?state=TN&limit=50` (with Amir's JWT in the `Authorization` header).
2. **Expect:** `{"total": <number>, "items": [...]}`. After §0.2, `total` should be ~191,531.

### 4.6 User management (direct Cypher)

```powershell
docker exec sentinel-g-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p sentinel_dev_pwd `
  "MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.email, u.role, u.is_active ORDER BY u.email"
```

To promote a self-registered user to admin:

```powershell
docker exec sentinel-g-neo4j cypher-shell -u neo4j -p sentinel_dev_pwd `
  "MATCH (u:User {email: 'someone@example.com'}) SET u.role = 'admin' RETURN u.email, u.role"
```

> The user must log out and log back in for the new role claim to appear in their JWT.

### Amir's verification checklist

- [ ] Login as `amir@demo.in` works
- [ ] `/health`, `/health/ml`, `/health/neo4j` all return 200
- [ ] All fraud demo CIN reports download
- [ ] `override_applied: true` for IL&FS + DHFL + Bhushan Steel; `false` for Infosys
- [ ] `/companies?state=TN` returns rows
- [ ] cypher-shell can query and update `:User` nodes
- [ ] No 403 errors anywhere — admin has full access

**403 expectations:** every `❌ 403` cell returns:
`{"detail": "Role '<role>' is not authorised for this endpoint. Required one of: [...]"}`.
Not 401, not 500. A different code = regression.

## Section 7 — What's NOT covered by this walkthrough

- **Live MCA Public Portal scraping** — requires `python -m backend.app.ingest.mca_public_playwright --bootstrap` to bank session cookies. Without it, non-seeded CINs return 404. See `docs/INGEST_MCA_PUBLIC.md`.
- **Gemini Flash narrative** — runs in template-fallback mode in dev (no `GEMINI_API_KEY`). Still grounded in real numbers. Set a real Google AI Studio key in `.env.local` to flip it on.
- **NCLT / RBI Wilful Defaulter live polling** — scrapers are coded (`ibbi_fetcher.py`, `rbi_fetcher.py`, `gstn_fetcher.py`, `nclt.py`) but run against fixture sources in dev.
- **Production deployment** — see `docs/DEPLOY_ORACLE.md` / `DEPLOY_MILESWEB.md` / `DEPLOY_ORACLE_AMPERE.md`.
