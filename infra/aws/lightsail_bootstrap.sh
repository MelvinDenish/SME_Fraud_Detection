# Sentinel-G — AWS Lightsail fresh-VM bootstrap.
#
# Run this ONCE on a fresh Lightsail Ubuntu 24 LTS instance. Idempotent:
# safe to re-run if something fails midway.
#
# Pre-requisites the operator must have set BEFORE invoking this:
#   1. SSH'd into the VM as `ubuntu`.
#   2. cloned the repo to ~/sentinel-g, OR uploaded via scp to that path.
#   3. Filled out `infra/aws/.env` from `.env.example`.
#
# This script:
#   - Installs Docker engine + compose plugin (skipped if already present).
#   - Adds `ubuntu` to the docker group.
#   - Symlinks the compose file + Caddyfile + .env to the standard locations.
#   - Pulls the FastAPI image from public GHCR (no auth needed).
#   - `docker compose up -d` in the right directory.
#   - Waits for the Neo4j healthcheck.
#   - Runs `scripts/seed_users.py` against the in-stack Neo4j.
#   - Smoke-tests /health.
#
# See docs/DEPLOY_AWS_LIGHTSAIL.md for the human walkthrough.
