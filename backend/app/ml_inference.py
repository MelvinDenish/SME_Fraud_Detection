"""Meta-learner inference bridge — wires the F1a/F1b/F1c artefacts into the
live /analyse path so PRD §7.1's `p_fraud_calibrated` and `p_fraud_interval`
stop being null.

This closes the gap LOCAL_TEST_REPORT §3.1 flagged: the ML tier exists
on disk (`ml/artifacts/{f1a_oof,f1b_isotonic,f1c_conformal}.joblib`) but
no backend code path loads it. The scorer calls `score_ml(bundle, ctx)`
from here and gets back `(p, low, high)` ready to set on `RiskReport`.

Design notes:

* Artefacts are loaded lazily on the first inference call (not at import
  time) so the backend boots even when `ml/artifacts/` is empty.
* Loading is guarded with a single asyncio lock — concurrent first-callers
  don't double-load.
* `compute_calibrated_probability` returns `None` for *both* fields when
  any artefact is missing or feature extraction fails; the scorer then
  emits the PRD §7.1 schema with explicit null (the documented
  fallback).
* No new dependencies — uses the same joblib / numpy already pinned for
  the ML training stack.
