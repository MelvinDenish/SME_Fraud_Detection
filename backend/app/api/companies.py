"""/companies — directory of `:Company` nodes already in Neo4j.

Backs the frontend Search page's "recently loaded" panel. Returns CIN +
name + state + registration year, sorted newest-first. Optionally filters
by state (e.g. `?state=TN`) and pages via `?limit=` / `?offset=`.

This endpoint is intentionally **read-only over Neo4j** — it does NOT
trigger live MCA Public Portal scrapes. The Search page uses it to show
the analyst what's already loaded; clicking a row routes to /analyse
which does the live work.
